# Remove web restrictions

> [GitHub](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/blob/master/src/UnblockWebRestrictions/), [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/391193)

## Introduction

> [English](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/blob/master/src/UnblockWebRestrictions/README.md), [中文简体](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/blob/master/src/UnblockWebRestrictions/README.zhCN.md)

The reason why this script is written is that it is very inconvenient to add / disable the domain name in the existing UserJS script, so write one yourself, which is convenient for my generation to use.

## Features

- Force selection / copy / paste
- Disable the small tail when copying web pages
- Allows quick enable / disable through the menu (main improvements)
- Dynamic update support domain name list (main improvements)
- Advanced matching mode

## Advanced Matching Mode

> [Local Rule Configuration Page](https://rxliuli.com/userjs/src/UnblockWebRestrictions/website/dist/)

This is a more powerful feature, not only matching domain names, but also matching urls, url prefixes, and regular expressions.

## Help

If you find a domain name that is not yet supported, you can click _Tampermonkey => Remove Webpage Restrictions => Remove Restrictions_ to take effect, or, put it on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/issues) , So that everyone can update the domain name to lift the restriction.
